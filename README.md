# üîç Automated Metadata Discovery and Analysis Framework with AI-Driven Contextualization

## Framework Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive framework for automated discovery, acquisition, and analysis of publicly available genomic data. The system combines programmatic data extraction,
and AI-driven metadata analysis to facilitate systematic data mining and interpretation.

## Core Framework Components**

- **Programmatic Data Extraction:** Automated interaction with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using Biopython
Systematic querying based on customizable search criteria and Metadata and dataset downloading capabilities


- **AI-Driven Metadata Analysis:** Integration with Llama 3.2 via Ollama for intelligent data labeling
Automated classification and contextualization of experimental metadata Enhanced dataset relevance assessment

# Demonstration: Application to Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Research

This repository demonstrates an automated approach to identifying, acquiring, and analyzing specific types of publicly available genomic data to support biomarker discovery for Parkinson's Disease (PD). The advancement of precision medicine in Parkinson's Disease (PD) requires easily accessible biomarkers from minimally invasive sources. We therefore hypothesized that Blood-based single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) data holds particular promise for this purpose.

## Why Biological Fluids and Single-Cell Transcriptomics?

**1. Clinical Utility:** We are interested in identifying biomarkers that can be easily and non-invasively obtained for the clinical detection of PD. Biological fluids, especially blood, offer a promising avenue for developing such diagnostic tools.

**2. Enhancing Resolution:** Previous analyses of bulk sequencing data have revealed transcriptomic differences between PD patients and healthy controls. However, these differences are often subtle at the bulk level. We hypothesize that by profiling these samples at single-cell resolution, we can maximize our ability to detect and characterize these differences, potentially uncovering cell type-specific biomarkers that are masked in bulk analyses. '''. What do you think?

# Technical Requirements
Note: This implementation requires Ollama installation. Detailed installation instructions and Docker configuration are provided in separate documentation.
