# üîç Automated Metadata Discovery and Analysis Framework with AI-Driven Contextualization
**Framework Overview**
This repository presents a comprehensive framework for automated discovery, acquisition, and analysis of publicly available genomic data. The system combines programmatic data extraction and AI-driven metadata analysis to facilitate systematic data mining and interpretation.

**Core Framework Components**
- Programmatic Data Extraction

  Automated interaction with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using Biopython
  Systematic querying based on customizable search criteria
  Efficient metadata and dataset downloading capabilities

- AI-Driven Metadata Analysis

  Integration with Llama 3.2 via Ollama for intelligent data labeling
  Automated classification and contextualization of experimental metadata
  Enhanced dataset relevance assessment

# Use Case: Single-cell RNA Sequencing in Parkinson's Disease

**Project Goal**
We demonstrate the framework's capabilities by screening public repositories for blood-based single-cell RNA sequencing data in Parkinson's Disease (PD). This addresses a key need in precision medicine: identifying easily accessible biomarkers from minimally invasive sources.

**Approach**

Our automated framework systematically:

Identifies relevant datasets
Acquires metadata and data files
Analyzes dataset characteristics and quality

**Scientific Rationale**

1. Clinical Utility

Focus on blood-based biomarkers for non-invasive PD detection
Emphasis on samples that can be easily obtained in clinical settings

2. Enhanced Resolution

Move beyond limitations of bulk sequencing analysis
Leverage single-cell resolution to detect subtle transcriptomic differences
Potential to uncover cell type-specific biomarkers masked in bulk analyses

# Technical Requirements

Ollama installation required
Detailed installation instructions and Docker configuration provided separately
