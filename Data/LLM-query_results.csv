GSE223138,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by bradycardia, static tremor, rigidity and postural instability. At present, the current knowledge remains inadequate for the connection between the disease severity and peripheral immune response. In the present study, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from clinical cases, including 2 early PD, 2 advance PD and 2 matched controls, representing five major immune cell subsets: T cells (CD4+, CD8+), monocytes, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The characteristic alterations of cell subset proportions were disentangled, in which T cells and NK cells were declined in the progression of PD. We further enlarged the sample size and collected peripheral blood samples of 14 normal individuals, 21 early and 14 advance PD patients. T cells and NK cells showed an obvious reduction in the blood samples as the disease proceeded. Moreover, NK cells infiltration into cerebral motor cortex indicated by immunostaining of human brain sections evidenced the close communication existing between peripheral immune response and central nervous system. Importantly, NK cells participated in numerous common immune-related biological processes. Strikingly, NK cell-specific XCL2 that was specifically expressed in cluster 6 was further identified and positively correlated with the PD severity. All these findings delineated the critical role of peripheral adaptive immune response, especially mediated by NK cells, in the pathogenesis of PD, providing clues of immune-related biomarkers or therapeutic targets during PD progression in future investigations.In this study, we presented 5 major immune cell subsets, T cells (CD4+, CD8+), B cells, NK cells, monocytes and HSCs, and displayed the distinct proportion of cell subsets and different gene expression patterns in the progression of PD by scRNA-seq analysis. Among these cell subsets, T cells and NK cells were found decreased as the disease proceeded, which was evidenced by the decreased percentage of T cells and NK cells in PD patients with the increase of severity with the clinical sample size enlarged. Moreover, the NK cell type-specific key genes were proved to be involved in PD related signal transduction and immune regulation. Correlation analysis revealed the number of NK cells was negatively correlated with the severity of PD. Strikingly, NK cells were found expressed in the motor cortex of human brain sections from PD patients. Importantly, NK cell-specific crucial gene was identified in the present study (XCL2), which might present great potentials as PD-associated biomarkers.",Single-cell transcriptomics,Blood,"The study uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which indicates the use of scRNA-seq technology.

GSE237254,"Neuroinflammation in the brain contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the potential dysregulation of peripheral immunity has not been systematically investigated for idiopathic PD (iPD). Here we showed an elevated peripheral cytotoxic immune milieu, with more terminally-differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) CD8 T, CD8+ NKT cells and circulating cytotoxic molecules in fresh blood of early-to-mid iPD, especially in females, after analyzing >700 innate and adaptive features. This profile, also reflected by fewer CD8+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, was confirmed in another subcohort. Co-expression between cytotoxic molecules was selectively enhanced in CD8 TEMRA and effector memory (TEM) cells. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated the accelerated CD8 differentiation within CD8 compartments, enhanced cytotoxic pathways in CD8 TEMRA and TEM cells, while CD8 central-memory (TCM) and naïve cells were already more-active and transcriptionally-reprogrammed. Our work provides a comprehensive map of dysregulated peripheral immunity in iPD, proposing previously-unrecognized candidates for early diagnosis and treatments.We compared samples between patients with early-to-mid idiopathic Parkinson’s diseases (iPD) and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Four HC were 59-65 years old (mean=62.33) while five iPD were 56-68 years old (mean=63.14) when they were sampled. Considering our female-biased data in clinical diagnostic values, we only selected female iPD vs age-matched HC for scRNA-seq. All the iPD and HC are CMV seropositive (for other inclusion and exclusion criteria, please refer to the manuscript). All the iPD have a Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging scale of 2. All the PBMC were cryopreserved at the Luxembourg biobank (IBBL) and thawed (for detailed procedures, please refer to the manuscript text). After thawing, PBMC from each participant were stained with marker Abs and sorted into four CD8 subsets: CD8 Naïve (CD45RO-CCR7+), CD8 TCM (CD45RO+CCR7+), CD8 TEM (CD45RO+CCR7-) and CD8 TEMRA (CD45RO-CCR7-). For each subset, we pooled the sorted samples from the same group (HC or iPD) prior to scRNA-seq. The processed files provided in this dataset are the starting point of our scRNA-seq analysis. For detailed analysis steps, please refer to the Methods section of our manuscript including all the code depository information.",Single-cell transcriptomics,PBMC-sorted cells,"The study uses scRNA-seq analysis to investigate peripheral immunity in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).

GSE46798,"Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by extensive loss of A9 dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). A strong association has been reported between PD and exposure to mitochondrial toxins such as the environmental pesticides paraquat, maneb, and rotenone. Here, using a robust, patient-derived, stem cell model of PD that allows comparison of -synuclein ( -syn) mutant cells and isogeneic mutation-corrected controls, we identify mitochondrial toxin-induced perturbations specific to A53T -syn mutant A9-DA neurons (hNs). We report a novel molecular pathway whereby basal as well as toxin-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress inhibits the MEF2C-PGC1 transcription network in A53T hNs compared to corrected controls, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic cell death. Our data provide mechanistic insight into gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, using small molecule high-throughput screening, we identify the MEF2C-PGC1 pathway as a new drug target for therapeutic benefit in PD.In the current study, isogenic hiPSCs differing exclusively at a single amino acid (A53T) were exposed to either 2.8uM paraquat in combination with 1uM maneb for 24h or PBS vehicle control.

GSE93285,"Tissue-resident macrophages such as microglia, Kupffer and Langerhans cells derive from Myb-independent yolk sac (YS) progenitors generated before the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Myb-independent YS-derived resident macrophages self-renew locally, independently of circulating monocytes and HSCs. In contrast, adult blood monocytes as well as infiltrating, gut and dermal macrophages derive from Myb-dependent HSCs. These findings are derived from the mouse, using gene knock-outs and lineage tracing, but their applicability to human development has not been formally demonstrated. Here we use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a tool to model human hematopoietic development. By using a CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out strategy we show that human iPSC-derived monocytes/macrophages develop in a MYB-independent, RUNX1 and SPI1 (PU.1)-dependent fashion. This result makes human iPSC-derived macrophages developmentally related to and a good model for MYB-independent tissue-resident macrophages such as alveolar and kidney macrophages, microglia, Kupffer and Langerhans cells.The human hiPSC-AH016-3 has been used for all CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene targeting in this study. iPSC-AH016-3 has been targeted using a double nicking CRISPR-Cas9 strategy for the knock-out of MYB, SPI1 and RUNX1. Seven lines were generated: a WT control line which underwent CRISPR-Cas9 transfection and single cell cloning but is unmodified, 3 MYB double allele knock-outs, a MYB single allele knock-out, a SPI1 double allele knock-out and a RUNX1 double allele knock-out. SNP datasets were generated from knock-out and control lines.

GSE141578,"Recent studies indicate that the adaptive immune system plays a role in Lewy body dementia (LBD). However, the mechanism regulating T cell brain homing in LBD is unknown. Here, we observed T cells adjacent to Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurons in post-mortem LBD brains. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified upregulated expression of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) in CD4+ T cells in LBD. CSF protein levels of the CXCR4 ligand, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12) were associated with neuroaxonal damage in LBD. Furthermore, we observed clonal expansion and upregulated Interleukin 17A expression by CD4+ T cells stimulated with a phosphorylated α-synuclein epitope. Thus, CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling may represent a mechanistic target for inhibiting pathological interleukin-17-producing T cell trafficking in LBD.scRNAseq of CSF cells from healthy (n=11) and LBD (n=11) subjects.

GSE243639,"Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The pathological hallmark of PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of aggregated α-synuclein, primarily in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathology in different cell types is not currently understood. Here, we present a single nuclei transcriptomic analysis of human post-mortem in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) tissue from 15 sporadic Parkinson’s Disease (PD) cases and 14 Controls. Our dataset comprised of ∼80K nuclei, representing all major cell types of the brain and allowed us to obtain a transcriptome-level characterization of these cell types. Importantly, we identified multiple subpopulations for each cell type and described subpopulation-specific gene sets that provide insights into the differing roles of these subpopulations. Our findings revealed a significant decrease in neuronal cells in PD samples, accompanied by an increase in glial cells and T cells. Subpopulation analyses demonstrated a significant depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive astrocyte, microglia, and oligodendrocyte populations, along with the TH-expressing neurons in PD samples, which were also depleted. Moreover, marker gene analysis of the depleted subpopulations identified 28 overlapping genes including those associated with dopamine metabolism (e.g., ALDH1A1, SLC6A3 & SLC18A2). Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in dopaminergic neuron degeneration and glial responses in PD, highlighting the existence of novel subpopulations and cell type-specific gene sets.We present a large-scale single nuclei RNA-seq dataset of 29 post-mortems human brains collected from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of 15 sporadic PD and 14 control samples obtained from Oregon Brain Bank. The Ethics Committee of UZ Leuven/KU Leuven approved the current study under the S-number S64182. H&E-guided 2 mm biopsy punches were collected from the SNpc of selected samples, nuclei were isolated and sequencing libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3 Reagent Kits v.3 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics). The generated scRNA-seq libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq6000 system: 1% PhiX, paired-end sequencing with 10X v3 parameters (28-8-0-91 cycles). 13 libraries having a saturation rate lower than 60% were re-sequenced with the same 10x parameters to obtain more reads and improve the quality of the database. Combining reads from both runs giving a >40% saturation rate for all the samples was achieved. In total >170K nuclei was sequenced.",Single-cell transcriptomics,PBMC-sorted cells,"The text explicitly mentions using scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA sequencing) technology and sorting of specific cell types before single-cell analysis.

GSE135051,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder in which neuroinflammation plays a critical function. Recurring viral infections and loss of immune competence increase risk for developing AD, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving these immune changes are unknown. Here we performed mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and detected an immunologic signature of AD characterized by increased numbers of CD8+ T effector memory CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells. CD8+ TEMRA cells were negatively associated with cognition and single cell RNA sequencing revealed their cytotoxic effector function. Strikingly, we discovered identical, shared T cell receptors (TCRs) of clonally expanded CD8+ TEMRA cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of three AD patients. Deep TCR sequencing, machine learning, and peptide screens identified the HLA-B*08:01-restricted Epstein-Barr virus trans-activator protein BZLF1 as the cognate antigen of a novel AD CSF TCR .

GSE176160,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder arises from multiple genetic and environmental factors. However, underlying pathological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics, we analyze human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) from sporadic PD (sPD) patients. Alterations in gene expression appear in pathways related to primary cilia (PC). Accordingly, in these hiPSC-derived hNPCs and neurons, we observe a shortening of PC. Additionally, we detect a shortening of PC in PINK1-deficient human cellular and mouse models of familial PD. Furthermore, in sPD models, the shortening of PC is accompanied by an increased SHH signal transduction. Inhibition of this pathway rescues the alterations in PC morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, increased SHH activity due to ciliary dysfunction is needed for the development of pathoetiological phenotypes observed in sPD, like mitochondrial dysfunction. In sum, altered PC function is part of early PD pathoetiology and inhibiting the overactive SHH signaling is a potential neuroprotective therapy.Single-cell transcriptome analysis of human neural precursor cells derived from 6 healthy individuals, 7 late-onset sporadic PD patients and 1 cell line with a familial PD mutation.",Single-cell transcriptomics,Other sample,"Although the text mentions analyzing human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) and neurons using multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics, it does not explicitly mention PBMCs or whole blood samples.

GSE166790,"Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin cause autosomal recessive Parkinson’s disease. In concert with PINK1, Parkin regulates the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria via lysosomes. In response, new mitochondria are generated through an interplay of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Mouse and overexpression models suggests that Parkin also influences these processes, both in the nuclear cascade and at the level of the mitochondrial genome. Additionally, Parkin has been shown to prevent mitochondrial membrane permeation, impeding the escape of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In line with this, serum from Parkin mutation carriers showed higher levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) and inflammatory cytokines – a result of the innate immune response - which can be triggered by cytosolic mtDNA. However, Parkin’s relationship with the mitochondrial genome and the mitogenesis pathway has not been explored in patient-derived neurons. To investigate this aspect of Parkin’s cellular function endogenously, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain neurons from Parkin mutation carriers and healthy controls. In Parkin-deficient cells, several factors in the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway were significantly reduced, resulting in impaired mtDNA homeostasis - a phenomenon that was exacerbated in dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, in response to a lack of freely accessible NAD+, the energy sensor Sirtuin 1, which simultaneously controls mtDNA maintenance processes and mitophagy, was downregulated in Parkin-deficient neurons. However, while impaired lysosomal degradation of mitochondria was only detectable in oxidative conditions, biogenesis defects were already apparent in untreated patient neurons. This may suggest that mitophagy disruption occurs in response to acute stress. By contrast, the biogenesis pathway may be continually impaired in Parkin-associated Parkinson’s disease. Next, using a mutagenic stress model in combination with Parkin knockdown, we detected an increase in ccf-mtDNA and the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS. To explore if ccf-mtDNA can act as damage-associated molecular pattern in the brain, we used postmortem tissue from a Parkin mutation carrier and performed single-cell RNA sequencing. In the midbrain lacking Parkin, we found a higher percentage of microglia along with an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in these cells. Together, our findings suggest a role for Parkin in the control of mitochondrial biogenesis and mtDNA maintenance, which protects midbrain neurons from neuroinflammation-induced degeneration. Future research in iPSC-derived neuron-microglia co-culture systems could aim at developing PD treatment approaches that target the neuronal release or microglial uptake of ccf-mtDNA.Single-cell transcriptome of postmortem midbrain of one Parkin mutation carrier and two control individuals (GSM4774937 and GSM4774938)",Single-cell transcriptomics,PBMC-sorted cells,"The study uses postmortem tissue for single-cell RNA sequencing, indicating the use of single-cell transcriptomics technology. The text also mentions 'midbrain lacking Parkin' and 'microglia along with an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in these cells', suggesting that the sample is derived from neurons or glial cells, which are types of cells found in the brain and spinal cord, but more specifically, microglia are a type of glial cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord, acting as the main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system. This classification aligns with 'PBMC-sorted cells' because it is not explicitly mentioned that PBMCs were used without prior sorting, but rather that the sample was derived from postmortem midbrain tissue which contains microglia."
GSE202210,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder where recent evidence suggests pathogenesis may be mediated by inflammatory processes. The molecular architecture of the disease remains to be fully elucidated. We performed single-nucleus transcriptomics and unbiased proteomics using postmortem tissue obtained from the prefrontal cortex of 12 individuals with late-stage PD and age-matched controls. We analyzed ~80,000 nuclei and identified eight major cell types, including brain-resident T cells, each with distinct transcriptional changes in line with the known genetics of PD. By analyzing Lewy body pathology in the same postmortem tissue, we found that α-synuclein pathology is inversely correlated with chaperone expression in excitatory neurons. Examining cell-cell interactions, we found a selective abatement of neuron-astrocyte interactions and enhanced neuroinflammation. Proteomic analyses of the same brains identified synaptic proteins in prefrontal cortex that were preferentially downregulated in PD. Strikingly, comparing this dataset to a regionally similar published analysis for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we found no common differentially expressed genes in neurons, but identified many shared differentially expressed genes in glial cells, suggesting that disease etiology in PD and AD are likely distinct. These data are presented as a resource for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.From 12 individuals with and without PD, we isolated brain nuclei from prefrontal cortex by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, generated single nucleus libraries with 10x Chromium platform (10x Genomics), and sequenced on NovaSeq6000 S4 sequencer (Illumina).",Single-cell transcriptomics,PBMC-sorted cells,"Although the text does not explicitly mention PBMCs, it mentions sorting or isolation of specific cell types before single-cell analysis.
